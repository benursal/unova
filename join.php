				<h3>Core Values and Beliefs</h3>
				<p>
					The UNOVA Health team is a group of highly dedicated orthopaedic 
					professionals who are not only excellent clinicians but also kind, 
					compassionate people fanatical about the health of our patients.<br /><br />

					We believe that improving care and patient satisfaction requires 
					unconventional thinking, innovative technology and an unrelenting 
					determination to succeed.<br /><br />

					The old system doesn’t work. We must build a new, value-based 
					system that puts patients first and improves every aspect of their 
					experience.<br /><br />

					We want to be the Apple or Tesla of the health industry. We will 
					disrupt the status quo and become the agents of change in heathcare.<br /><br />

					We’re driven by passion and purpose, not profits. We will do well by 
					doing good!

					<h3>A Great Place to Call Home</h3>
					<p>
						The UNOVA Health campus is located in Lady Lake, a charming 
						hometown community with an abundance of palm trees and 
						sunshine.<br /><br />

						Approximately a one-hour drive from Orlando, Lady Lake is 
						close enough to enjoy its worldclass theme parks but far 
						enough away to avoid the traffic and crowds.<br /><br />

						Ideal for raising a family, the area has its own elementary, 
						middle and high schools, both public and private, as well as a 
						high-performing charter school. And there’s no shortage of 
						youth sports and extra-curricular activities for your Little 
						League slugger or budding ballerina.<br /><br />

						If you’d prefer to spend your weekends floating in your 
						swimming pool or taking your kids to the park or beach 
						year-round rather than shoveling snow and scraping the ice 
						off your windshield each morning, then you’ll love it here!
