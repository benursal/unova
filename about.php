				<h3>Our Vision</h3>
				<p>
					UNOVA Health is the brainchild of experienced orthopaedic surgeons. 
					They envisioned a progressive practice where patients could receive all 
					the care for their orthopaedic episode (Diagnosis, Optimization, 
					Intervention, Recovery and Maintenance) under one roof.<br /><br />

					Care is delivered by Fellowship-trained and/or board-certified surgical 
					and office-based Orthopaedic Surgeons, PCP’s, PM&R’s, as well as 
					certified mid-levels, PT’s, PTA’s and MA’s.  All required ancillaries would 
					be on hand: Imaging, PT, DME, Lab, Pharmacy, Urgent Care, Clinical 
					Research, Gait Analysis Lab.<br /><br />

					Designed from the ground up, this innovative practice model would 
					integrate clinical and ancillary services in a single, state-of-the-art 
					facility that provides an unmatched patient experience and greatly 
					improves the outcomes of orthopaedic patients.<br /><br />

					This model would also create significant cost efficiencies, a necessity 
					in a healthcare market evolving toward value-based reimbursement 
					models. Our practice will be successful in any type of reimbursement 
					model.<br /><br />

					After years of planning and development, this vision will soon become 
					reality. The ideal location, full funding and a dedicated team of 
					founding partners are now coming together in UNOVA Health.
